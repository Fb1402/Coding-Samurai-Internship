BUSINESS ANALYTICS INTERNSHIP - Task

Project Idea: Employee Attrition Analysis

Dataset: You can use the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, which is available on Kaggle: IBM HR Analytics Dataset. Project Description: In this project, you'll analyze employee data to understand the factors that contribute to employee attrition. Employee attrition can be costly for businesses, and identifying the root causes can help in retention efforts.

Steps You can Follow:

Data Exploration: Download the dataset and explore its contents. Understand the variables and their meanings.

Data Cleaning: Clean the data by handling missing values and checking for outliers. Ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

Attrition Analysis: Calculate the attrition rate and examine the distribution of attrition across different employee demographics (e.g., age, gender, department).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to identify potential factors associated with attrition. Use visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to explore relationships between variables.

Feature Importance: Use techniques like feature importance or correlation analysis to identify which factors have the most significant impact on attrition.

Predictive Modeling (Optional): If you're comfortable with machine learning, you can build a simple attrition prediction model using classification algorithms. This step is optional but can provide valuable insights.

Recommendations: Based on your analysis, provide recommendations to the HR department or management on strategies to reduce attrition. For example, you might

suggest targeted training programs, improved benefits, or changes in management practices.

Visualization: Create visualizations to present your findings. Visuals can help convey information effectively.

Summary Report: Summarize your analysis, findings, and recommendations in a report or presentation.
